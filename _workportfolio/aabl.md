  During my sophomore to senior year of college I worked with the Assistive Agent Behavior and Learning Lab and Dr. Elaine Short to design algorithms for human-robot interaction. In my independent work I researched scaffolded shared autonomy in educational robotics and robot motion planning, I helped write a paer on Environment Guided Interactive Reinforcement Learning published in AAMAS 2022.

  I also served as teaching assistant to a grad-level Human-Robot Interaction class of 36 taught by Dr. Elaine Short, held office hours, and graded assignments.
