I built website and documentation platform for CEEO Innovations website on github pages using Javascript, JQuery, HTML/CSS, Jekyll, markdown, and git. The goal of this platform was to make it easy for non-coding users to create website pages using a modified version of Markdown that I programmed to allow sections within a page to have modulated styles.
