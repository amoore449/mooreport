From January 2023 to April 2024 I ran a youth makerspace at the Blue Hill Boys and Girls Club. In this roll, I developed daily afterschool programming to encourage interest in art, technology, and engineering. I taught daily afterschool and summer programs in 3D print, Scratch programming, music, clothing design, robotics, game design, and entrepreneurship to 1st-10th grade students in a high volume program seeing around 400 students a day. 

In addition to this I managed and stocked technology space, while guiding it a through a complete room redesign. Oversaw $5,000 starting budget and secured $1,200 additional grant funding. 

This was a managerial role where I supervised and trained adult and teen staff, including summer staff and a year-round assistant. I also established partnerships with organizations like MIT Media Lab, Girls Who Code, Girls on the Run, and Tufts Center for Engineering Education.
