I built an Augmented Reality (AR) Unity app mapping the Tufts University campus over 24 hours at Tufts Polyhacks 2019 with a 5 person team. Users could leave reviews to appear alongside CAD building models in the app. I created 3D building models in Autodesk Fusion and built the website in HTML/CSS. This project won the Trip Advisor award for best use of Travel API.
