I conducted a premilinary study on different policy shaping algorithms for cleaning robots adapting to different household social dynamics. The goal of this study was to tailor the behavior of household cleaning robots to both appease indivdual users within the house and to synchronize well with household dynamics overall. We tested four different hierarchical policy shaping algorithms in an online study to determine what robot response would be viewed as socially appropriate by users.
