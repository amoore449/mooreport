 Turning a page requires gripping the thin space between one page and the next, separating pages, and then having the arm control to turn a page over without ripping it. For someone with poor figer or joint dexterity, this task could be incredibly frustrating. I built a robotic page turner with gesture activated control to decrease the dexterity needed to turn a page and to make this task more accessible.
