   In this analog clock with two time indicators. The upper, servo-driven, indicator shows the minute, while the lower, stepper-driven, indicator shows the hour. We use a gearbox so that the stepper it can move a belt attached to the indicator. In our code, we translate the time value of the "datetime" function into "steps" to increment the motors.
