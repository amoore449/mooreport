This robot was built for the 2017 First Robotics Competition to stack latex covered cubes on a moving platform and climb alongside other robots on a rung. This robot placed 7th in the 2018 Silicon Valley Regional out of 60 teams, 3rd at CalGames 2018 out of 38 teams, and was a regional finalist at the 2018 Utah regional. I built the climbing mechanism for our robot and ran the Mechanical Design team with a partner.
