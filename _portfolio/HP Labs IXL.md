In 2017, I interned with the Immersive Experiences Lab (IXL) to study the applications of 3D printing and customization in clothing. Over the summer, I developed prototype customizable objects and conducted a qualitative study on user reactions. I also worked independently on a project exploring the idea of comfort/nonverbal communication through wearable technology.
