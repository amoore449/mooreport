In 2019, I worked on soft robotic grippers and on redesigning a silicon 3D printer with the Tufts Soft Robotics Exosuit Research team. I modeled and fabricated several different designs for silicon actuators to allow better airflow for a soft robotic exosuit gripper using CAD, laser cutting, and silicon mold casting.I also improved the control board design and mapped electronics on fritzing. To extend the team's silicon 3D printer design, I built a new attachment for the print extruder.
